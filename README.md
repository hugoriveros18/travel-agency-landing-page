## Overview

### Resume

This landing page was created as part of a practical exercise to test my own knowledge mainly in the CSS framework, Tailwind. It is important to mention that React.js was also used to obtain a cleaner code and a more optimized web page.


### Features

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate to the different sections on the page
- Toggle light and dark mode
